# Regex tests and exercises

Hello there! It's great to have you here!

This repository is just about my learning tests and exercises, and there's nothing such as a tutorial here!
But if you go through the files, you may find something useful for you, the files are well named, so maybe it does worth to try to go through them.
The file called "tests" in every folder are just about bubberish and random things, if you are curious, you can go there, but there's nothing special.
The other files are about exercises that I picked from Internet or the book Mastering Regular Expressions.

Enjoy!
